# The Cloud Native

_April 2017_

As though through a fog, you glimpse him.  
A slight movement against the stillness of the jungle.  
He is the maker, blending the services together, binding your view as though by magic.  

He is the native.  

He dances with the Lambdas, snuggles with the queues.  
He slides down the notifications and embraces the skills.  
He hunts the instances, never worrying about names.

He is the native.
